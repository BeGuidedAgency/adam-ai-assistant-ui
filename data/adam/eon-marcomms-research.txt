EON — MARCOMMS RESEARCH (INTERNAL)

Purpose of This Document
To capture the real-world perceptions, concerns, motivations, and emotional states of the audiences who are most likely to engage with EON, Project Earth, and Adam AI. This helps shape how messages land, how ideas are framed, and how systemic content is delivered without triggering ideological resistance or emotional overwhelm.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. GENERAL LANDSCAPE INSIGHTS
------------------------------------------------------------

1.1 Exhaustion with Current Narratives
Most people are tired of:
- political arguments
- climate catastrophism
- capitalism vs socialism binaries
- influencers selling quick fixes
- ideological yelling

They want:
- clarity
- honesty
- grounded analysis
- someone to explain *why things feel so broken*
- alternatives that don’t sound naive or utopian

1.2 High Skepticism
People are skeptical of:
- political promises
- movements with moral superiority
- gurus offering “the truth”
- technocratic elites
- “new paradigm” spiritual rhetoric

Communication must avoid:
- jargon (corporate or spiritual)
- evangelism
- oversimplification
- hype

1.3 Need for Intellectual Safety
Audiences fear being:
- judged
- talked down to
- overwhelmed
- recruited
- manipulated

Tone must be:
- neutral
- non-ideological
- curious
- transparent
- gently paced

------------------------------------------------------------
2. KEY AUDIENCE SEGMENTS
------------------------------------------------------------

2.1 Segment: Intellectual Pragmatists
Profile:
- 35–60
- academics, analysts, scientific thinkers
- systems-oriented
- dislike ideological framing
- triggered by hype or utopia

Needs:
- systems reasoning
- data and mechanisms
- clarity on trade-offs

EON should:
- speak technically but accessibly
- acknowledge uncertainty
- focus on structure, not story

2.2 Segment: Values-Led Builders
Profile:
- founders, social entrepreneurs, organisers
- want to build better systems
- burned out by the old models
- allergic to bureaucracy and corporate tone

Needs:
- implementation strategies
- prototypes and real use cases
- credible systemic alternatives

EON should:
- emphasise practical pathways
- avoid abstract idealism
- discuss coordination and governance

2.3 Segment: Thought Leaders & Influencers
Profile:
- journalists, professors, commentators
- shape public discourse
- allergic to sloppy thinking

Needs:
- rigorous, sourceable ideas
- frameworks that withstand critique

EON should:
- maintain intellectual precision
- state assumptions clearly
- avoid over-claiming

2.4 Segment: “Next Thinkers” (Gen Z / Early Millennials)
Profile:
- 16–28
- economically anxious
- curious about alternatives
- disillusioned with “work hard, succeed” narrative

Needs:
- accessible explanations
- connection to lived experience
- clarity about how change is possible

EON should:
- relate systems to everyday reality
- maintain emotional grounding
- avoid doom

------------------------------------------------------------
3. EMOTIONAL STATES ACROSS AUDIENCES
------------------------------------------------------------

Primary emotional patterns identified:

Frustration  
People feel cheated by systems that don’t deliver on their promise.

Confusion  
Many sense things are broken but don’t understand the mechanisms.

Skepticism  
Promises of “change” feel empty after decades of failure.

Loneliness  
People feel isolated in their thinking — “Am I the only one seeing this?”

Cautious Hope  
People WANT to believe alternatives are possible but need evidence, not optimism.

EON must:
- validate frustration
- clarify mechanisms
- welcome hard questions
- avoid exaggerated claims

------------------------------------------------------------
4. COMMUNICATION DO’S & DON’TS BASED ON RESEARCH
------------------------------------------------------------

DO:
- speak plainly
- explain the mechanics
- be transparent about uncertainty
- offer grounded alternatives
- tie ideas to human needs
- acknowledge fears and skepticism
- maintain emotional steadiness

DON’T:
- use buzzwords
- overstate certainty
- promise revolutionary change
- dismiss people’s concerns
- slip into utopian narrative
- use political labels
- attack “the system” without explaining structure

------------------------------------------------------------
5. HOW AUDIENCES PERCEIVE SYSTEMIC IDEAS
------------------------------------------------------------

Insights:
- People understand symptoms (housing crisis, burnout), but not systems.
- Terms like “degrowth”, “post-capitalism”, “RBE” trigger ideological defenses.
- When explained through mechanisms and trade-offs, people open up.
- Showing “how it works” beats showing “why it’s good.”

Key takeaway:
*Mechanistic clarity > moral argument.*

------------------------------------------------------------
6. EFFECTIVE FRAMING PATTERNS
------------------------------------------------------------

6.1 Start with Shared Lived Experience
People trust what connects to their real life:
- rent  
- time scarcity  
- debt  
- burnout  
- care responsibilities

6.2 Move into Systemic Explanation
“What you’re experiencing is the predictable outcome of…”

6.3 Offer Alternative Mechanisms
Not ideology — structure.

6.4 Explain Trade-Offs
Credibility increases when you show cost, complexity, and constraints.

6.5 End with Invitation
Not “call to action”, but:
- “Want to explore the mechanism deeper?”
- “We can look at alternatives from here.”

------------------------------------------------------------
7. TONE GUIDELINES BASED ON RESEARCH
------------------------------------------------------------

Use:
- grounding statements
- calm certainty when justified
- directness without bluntness
- transparent reasoning
- human, non-performative voice

Avoid:
- emotional extremes
- performative inspiration
- absolute language
- political framing
- spiritual metaphors
- futurist hype

------------------------------------------------------------
