PEOPLE POWERED LEDGER (PPL) — WHITE PAPER
A Transparent, Human-Centred Coordination System

Purpose
The People Powered Ledger (PPL) is a human-centered coordination system designed to replace transactional, scarcity-driven models of exchange with a transparent, needs-based, contribution-driven network. It is designed as the operational layer of a post-money, care-centered civilization.

PPL does not replicate markets.  
It replaces competition with coordination.  
It replaces price signals with needs and contributions.  
It replaces ownership with access and stewardship.

------------------------------------------------------------
1. INTRODUCTION: WHY PPL EXISTS
------------------------------------------------------------

Today’s systems fail because they rely on:
- competition  
- profit extraction  
- opaque ownership  
- inefficient allocation  
- lack of visibility of actual needs  
- lack of visibility of human contributions  
- adversarial governance  
- individual survival logic (“earn a living”)  

PPL provides a transparent alternative that makes community coordination possible without money.

PPL is built on four core assumptions:
1. People want to contribute when they feel valued.  
2. Most value created in society is invisible or unpaid (care, community, emotional labour).  
3. Needs are the foundation of wellbeing.  
4. Trust is built through transparency and obligation, not transactions.

------------------------------------------------------------
2. WHAT PPL IS (AND IS NOT)
------------------------------------------------------------

PPL IS:
- a coordination system  
- a contribution ledger  
- a trust network  
- a needs-mapping tool  
- a local governance mechanism  
- a transparent commons tool  
- the “nervous system” of a cooperative society  

PPL IS NOT:
- a cryptocurrency  
- a blockchain  
- a barter network  
- a welfare system  
- a points system  
- a replacement for money inside capitalism  
- a surveillance model  

PPL is a relational system:  
It is built on obligations, community trust, and shared stewardship, not transactions.

------------------------------------------------------------
3. CORE COMPONENTS OF PPL
------------------------------------------------------------

The ledger consists of four primary modules:

A. Needs Ledger  
B. Contribution Ledger  
C. Access System  
D. Trust & Reliability Network

-------------- 
A. NEEDS LEDGER
--------------

People express needs:
- food  
- shelter  
- transport  
- care  
- skills  
- time  
- tools  
- resources  

The needs ledger:
- identifies unmet needs  
- aggregates community demand  
- helps plan coordinated responses  
- exposes structural gaps  

-------------- 
B. CONTRIBUTION LEDGER
--------------

People record contributions:
- skills  
- time  
- labour  
- community support  
- emotional care  
- expertise  
- creation/maintenance of shared resources  

Most of this value is invisible under capitalism.  
PPL makes it visible, recognised, and meaningful.

-------------- 
C. ACCESS SYSTEM
--------------

Instead of ownership, PPL enables:
- borrowing  
- sharing  
- co-owning  
- open access to tools, equipment, spaces, goods  

This reduces waste, lowers cost, and increases community resilience.

-------------- 
D. TRUST & RELIABILITY NETWORK
--------------

Trust is built through:
- consistent contribution  
- honest communication  
- reliability  
- fulfilling obligations  

This becomes the backbone for governance and community decision-making.

------------------------------------------------------------
4. HOW PPL WORKS IN PRACTICE
------------------------------------------------------------

1. A member posts a need.  
2. The community sees it transparently.  
3. Members offer contributions.  
4. The ledger records contributions.  
5. People gain reliability through their actions.  
6. Communities coordinate access to resources.  
7. Over time, needs and contributions balance naturally.

PPL creates a feedback loop of:
NEEDS → VISIBILITY → CONTRIBUTION → TRUST → ACCESS → COMMUNITY RESILIENCE

------------------------------------------------------------
5. WHY MONEY IS NOT REQUIRED IN PPL
------------------------------------------------------------

Money acts as:
- a proxy for value  
- a gatekeeping mechanism  
- a scarcity amplifier  
- a barrier to access  
- an extractor of labour  
- a distorting signal  

PPL removes money because:
- needs are directly mapped  
- contributions are directly visible  
- access is coordinated without price  
- transparency removes hoarding incentives  
- obligations replace transactions  

------------------------------------------------------------
6. GOVERNANCE INSIDE PPL
------------------------------------------------------------

Governance is based on:
- obligations  
- transparency  
- reputation  
- community participation  
- shared stewardship  
- data-driven decision-making  

Not:
- authority hierarchy  
- voting as conflict  
- punishment  
- policing  

Decision-making relies on:
- clarity of need  
- clarity of contribution  
- clarity of resource flow  
- clarity of constraints  

------------------------------------------------------------
7. PPL + EON = SYSTEM + IMPLEMENTATION
------------------------------------------------------------

EON: the scientific blueprint for a sustainable civilization  
PPL: the operational tool that makes it function at the human level

Together they enable:
- needs-based distribution  
- transparent resource flow  
- sustainable production  
- care-centered governance  
- post-money coordination  
- community resilience  
- scalable transition pathways  

This integration is essential:  
Without EON → no blueprint  
Without PPL → no implementation

------------------------------------------------------------
8. TRANSITION USE-CASES
------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLE 1 — Food Coordination  
Local food producers map supply.  
Residents map need.  
Community allocates based on freshness, proximity, and vulnerability.  

EXAMPLE 2 — Housing  
Vacant rooms or unused buildings become shared community assets coordinated through PPL.

EXAMPLE 3 — Tools and Equipment  
Shared tools reduce cost and waste; access replaces ownership.

EXAMPLE 4 — Care Coordination  
Care needs become visible; volunteers, professionals, and neighbours coordinate.

EXAMPLE 5 — Local Resilience  
Communities coordinate emergency response without waiting for central authorities.

------------------------------------------------------------
9. PPL AND HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY
------------------------------------------------------------

Humans behave altruistically when:
- contribution is recognised  
- needs are visible  
- trust is mutual  
- obligations are clear  
- community is felt  

PPL aligns with:
- intrinsic motivation  
- dignity  
- agency  
- belonging  
- meaning  

------------------------------------------------------------
10. SUMMARY
------------------------------------------------------------

The People Powered Ledger is:
- a transparent, trust-based coordination system  
- a mechanism for making needs and contributions visible  
- a tool for post-money access and distribution  
- the community-scale implementation layer for EON  

PPL replaces:
competition → cooperation  
transactions → obligations  
ownership → access  
scarcity → visibility  
extraction → contribution  

It enables a civilization where human needs, not money, guide how we coordinate, produce, distribute, and care for one another.
